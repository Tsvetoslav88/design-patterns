## Introduction
Creational design patterns are concerned with **the way of creating objects**. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

## Types of creational design patterns
There are following 6 types of creational design patterns:

1. [Prototype](creational-pattern/Prototype)
2. [Factory-Method](creational-pattern/factory-method)
3. [Abstract-Factory](creational-pattern/abstract-factory)
4. [Builder](creational-pattern/builder)
5. [Singleton](creational-pattern/singleton)
