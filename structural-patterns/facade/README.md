### Description
A Facade Pattern says that just "**just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client**".

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.

#### Advantage of Facade Pattern
- It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
- It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

#### Usage of Facade Pattern:
It is used:
- When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
- When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
